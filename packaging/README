===== WELCOME =====

The GridWay Metascheduler enables large-scale, reliable and efficient sharing 
of computing resources: clusters, supercomputers, stand-alone servers... It
supports different LRM systems (PBS, SGE, LSF, Condor) within a single
organization or scattered across several administrative domains. GridWay
provides a single point of access to all resources in your organization, from
in-house systems to Grid infrastructures and Cloud providers.

GridWay supports most of existing Grid middlewares (Globus WS and pre-WS, LCG, 
CREAM, ARC) and has being used on main production Grid infrastructures (EGEE,
OSG, TeraGrid).

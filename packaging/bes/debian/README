===== INSTALLATION =====

The binary DEB package gridway-bes installs the GridWay MAD to interface with OGSA-BES services, as well as an static information MAD and a dummy transfer MAD are provided. It supports GridSAM and UNICORE as target implementations of the OGSA-BES interface.

1) Install DEB dependencies: gridway-core, libxmlbeans-java, libaxis-java,
libwsdl4j-java, libxalan2-java and default-jre.
Other dependencies (non DEB): gridsam-schema (check the default location in 
GW_em_mad_bes).

2) Post-install configuration:

a) This DEB provides a basic configuration of the MADs through the file
/usr/etc/gwd.conf (check the Configuration Guide) to interface with GridSAM 
instances. Don't forget to set up your GridFTP server. Uncomment the 
corresponding section to interface with UNICORE instances.
b) You must configure the available hosts for your GridWay instance (see the
example files /usr/etc/GridSAM_hosts.list and /usr/etc/UNICORE_hosts.list).
c) GridWay users must export the $GLOBUS_LOCATION environmental variable: 

   export GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr

d) Some privileges are required to be set in the /etc/sudoers file. Please add
the following lines.

   Defaults>GWUSERS env_keep="GW_LOCATION GLOBUS_LOCATION"
   #GridWay entries (OGSA-BES MAD)
   gwadmin ALL=(GWUSERS) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/GW_em_mad_bes *
   gwadmin ALL=(GWUSERS) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/gw_tm_mad_dummy *

e) Just for GridSAM: MyProxy is used for managing security credentials. Creates
a $HOME/.myproxy file, where the first line is the hostname of the MyProxy
server, the second line is the username and the last line is the password.
f) Configure the crypto.properties files in $GW_LOCATION/etc/.

3) Restart the gwd daemon.

4) Test it and enjoy!

The source DEB package gridway-BES enables you to build the binary DEB.
Build DEB dependencies: debhelper, libaxis-java, libxmlbeans-java,
libxalan2-java and default-jdk.
Other dependencies (non DEB): gridsam-schema (check the default location in 
Makefile and gw_em_mad_bes.sh).

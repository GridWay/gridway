===== WELCOME =====

The GridWay Metascheduler enables large-scale, reliable and efficient sharing 
of computing resources: clusters, supercomputers, stand-alone servers... It
supports different LRM systems within a single organization or scattered across
several administrative domains. GridWay provides a single point of access to all
resources in your organization, from in-house systems to Grid infrastructures
and Cloud providers.

GridWay supports most of existing Grid middlewares and has being used on main
production Grid infrastructures.

===== INSTALLATION =====

The binary RPM package gridway-BES installs the GridWay MAD to interface with
OGSA-BES services, as well as an static information MAD and a dummy transfer 
MAD are provided. It supports GridSAM and UNICORE as target implementations of 
the OGSA-BES interface.

1) Install RPM dependencies: gridway-core, java, axis, wsdl4j, log4j and 
xalan-j2.
Other dependencies (non RPM): gridsam-schema, xmlbeans (check the default 
location in GW_em_mad_bes).

2) Post-install configuration:

a) This RPM provides a basic configuration of the MADs through the file
/usr/etc/gwd.conf (check the Configuration Guide) to interface with GridSAM 
instances. Don't forget to set up your GridFTP server. Uncomment the 
corresponding section to interface with UNICORE instances.
b) You must configure the available hosts for your GridWay instance (see the
example files /usr/etc/GridSAM_hosts.list and /usr/etc/UNICORE_hosts.list).
c) GridWay users must export the $GLOBUS_LOCATION environmental variable: 

   export GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr

d) Some privileges are required to be set in the /etc/sudoers file. Please add
the following lines.

   Defaults>GWUSERS env_keep="GW_LOCATION GLOBUS_LOCATION"
   #GridWay entries (OGSA-BES MAD)
   gwadmin ALL=(GWUSERS) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/GW_em_mad_bes *
   gwadmin ALL=(GWUSERS) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/gw_tm_mad_dummy *

e) Just for GridSAM: MyProxy is used for managing security credentials. Creates 
a $HOME/.myproxy file, where the first line is the hostname of the MyProxy 
server, the second line is the username and the last line is the password.
f) Configure the crypto.properties file in $GW_LOCATION/etc/.

3) Restart the gwd daemon.

4) Test it and enjoy!

The source RPM package gridway-BES enables you to build the binary RPM.
Build RPM dependencies: java-devel, axis and xalan-j2.
Other dependencies (non RPM): gridsam-schema and xmlbeans (check the default
location in Makefile and gw_em_mad_bes.sh).

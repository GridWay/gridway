===== WELCOME =====

The GridWay Metascheduler enables large-scale, reliable and efficient sharing 
of computing resources: clusters, supercomputers, stand-alone servers... It
supports different LRM systems (PBS, SGE, LSF, Condor) within a single
organization or scattered across several administrative domains. GridWay
provides a single point of access to all resources in your organization, from
in-house systems to Grid infrastructures and Cloud providers.

GridWay supports most of existing Grid middlewares (Globus WS and pre-WS, LCG, 
CREAM, ARC) and has being used on main production Grid infrastructures (EGEE,
OSG, TeraGrid).

===== INSTALLATION =====

Check the Installation Guide for more details.

1) Install the GridWay Core: The binary RPM package gridway-core installs GridWay with a multi-user configuration.

1.1) Install RPM dependencies: chkconfig, initscripts, db4, db4-devel and db4-utils.
1.2) Post-install configuration:
- All of the GridWay users must be members of the gwusers UNIX group.
- GridWay users must export the $GW_LOCATION environmental variable: export GW_LOCATION=/usr
  You can create a profile file for gwusers group.
- Some privileges are required to be set in the /etc/sudoers file. Please add the below lines.
   Defaults:gwadmin !requiretty
   # User alias specification (GridWay)
   Runas_Alias GWUSERS = %gwusers
   Defaults>GWUSERS env_keep="GW_LOCATION"
   #GridWay entries
   gwadmin ALL=(GWUSERS) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/grid-proxy-info *

The source RPM package gridway-core enables you to build the binary RPM.
Build RPM dependencies: none

Check the Installation Guide for more details.

The binary DEB package gridway-core installs GridWay with a multi-user 
configuration.

1) Install DEB dependencies: libdb4.8 and globus-proxy-utils.

2) Post-install configuration:

a) All of the GridWay users must be members of the gwusers UNIX group.
b) GridWay users must export the $GW_LOCATION environmental variable: 

   export GW_LOCATION=/usr 

  You can create a profile file for gwusers group, such as:

   for i in `groups`; do
    if [ "$i" = 'gwusers' ]; then
     GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr
     GW_LOCATION=/usr
     export GLOBUS_LOCATION GW_LOCATION
    fi
   done

c) Some privileges are required to be set in the /etc/sudoers file. Please add
the following lines.

   Defaults:gwadmin !requiretty
   # User alias specification (GridWay)
   Runas_Alias GWUSERS = %gwusers
   Defaults>GWUSERS env_keep="GW_LOCATION"
   #GridWay entries
   gwadmin ALL=(GWUSERS) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/grid-proxy-info *

3) Install the GridWay MADs. Available drivers are provided by gridway-gt5 
(GridWay MADs to interface with the Globus Toolkit 5 services) and gridway-bes 
(GridWay MADs to interface with BES endpoints).

3) Restart the gwd daemon.

===== INSTALLATION =====

Check the Installation Guide for more details.

1) Install the GridWay Core: The binary DEB package gridway-core installs
GridWay with a multi-user configuration.

1.1) Install DEB dependencies: libdb4.8.
1.2) Post-install configuration:
- All of the GridWay users must be members of the gwusers UNIX group.
- GridWay users must export the $GW_LOCATION environmental variable: export
GW_LOCATION=/usr. You can create a profile file for gwusers group, such as:
  for i in `groups`; do
   if [ "$i" = 'gwusers' ]; then
    GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr
    GW_LOCATION=/usr
    export GLOBUS_LOCATION GW_LOCATION
   fi
  done
- Some privileges are required to be set in the /etc/sudoers file. Please add
the following lines.
   Defaults:gwadmin !requiretty
   # User alias specification (GridWay)
   Runas_Alias GWUSERS = %gwusers
   Defaults>GWUSERS env_keep="GW_LOCATION"
   #GridWay entries
   gwadmin ALL=(GWUSERS) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/grid-proxy-info *

The source DEB package gridway-core enables you to build the binary DEB. JAVA_HOME
must be previously exported.
Build DEB dependencies: debhelper and gcc.

2) Install the GridWay MADs

2a) GridWay MADs for GT5: The binary DEB package gridway-gt5 installs the
GridWay MADs to interface with the Globus Toolkit 5 services, GRAM5 and GridFTP,
as well as an static information MAD is provided.

libglobus-gass-copy-dev.
2.2a) Post-install configuration:
- This DEB provides a basic configuration of the MADs through the file
/usr/etc/gwd.conf (check the Configuration Guide).
- You must configure the available hosts for your GridWay instance (see the
example file /usr/etc/gram5_hosts.list).
- GridWay users must export the $GLOBUS_LOCATION environmental variable: export
GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr
- Some privileges are required to be set in the /etc/sudoers file. Please add
the following lines.
   Defaults>GWUSERS env_keep="GW_LOCATION GLOBUS_LOCATION"
   #GridWay entries (GT5 MAD)
   gwadmin ALL=(GWUSERS) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/gw_em_mad_gram5 *
   gwadmin ALL=(GWUSERS) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/gw_tm_mad_ftp *

The source DEB package gridway-gt5 enables you to build the binary DEB.
Build DEB dependencies: debhelper, gcc, libglobus-common-dev,
libglobus-gram-client-dev, libglobus-ftp-client-dev, libglobus-gass-copy-dev and

Other dependencies (non DEB): gridsam-schema and OMII security utils 
(check the default location in Makefile).
2.2b) Post-install configuration:
- This DEB provides a basic configuration of the MADs through the file
/usr/etc/gwd.conf (check the Configuration Guide). Set up your GridFTP server.
- You must configure the available hosts for your GridWay instance (see the
example file /usr/etc/BES_hosts.list).
- GridWay users must export the $GLOBUS_LOCATION environmental variable: export
GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr
- Some privileges are required to be set in the /etc/sudoers file. Please add
the following lines.
   Defaults>GWUSERS env_keep="GW_LOCATION GLOBUS_LOCATION"
   #GridWay entries (OGSA-BES MAD)
   gwadmin ALL=(GWUSERS) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/GW_em_mad_bes *
   gwadmin ALL=(GWUSERS) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/gw_tm_mad_dummy *

file, where the first line is the hostname of the MyProxy server, the second
line is the username and the last line is the password.

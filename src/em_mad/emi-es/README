===== WELCOME =====

EMI-ES (EMI Execution Service) is the execution service of EMI. It enables the 
job submission to CEs managed by ARC, gLite and UNICORE. EMI-ES uses ADL 
(Activity Description Language) to describe jobs.

This source distribution provides an Execution Manager Middleware Access 
Driver (EM MAD) for the EMI Execution Service.


===== REQUIREMENTS =====

The source distribution requires on the client-side:

- GridWay 5.14 (http://www.gridway.org)
- nordugrid-arc-plugins-needed, nordugrid-arc-debuginfo and nordugrid-arc-devel
 packages


===== INSTALLATION =====

This install procedure assumes that you have installed GridWay and you have 
access to a EMI-ES endpoint.

1) Install the required packages.
2) Change to src/em_mad/emi-es directory in the GridWay distribution.
3) Build and install the driver executing "make; make install".
4) Configure GridWay through the $GW_LOCATION/etc/gwd.conf file (check 
the GridWay Configuration Guide) to use the MAD. This EM MAD is intended 
to work with the "dummy" TM MAD configured for using a GridFTP server on 
the client. Use "adl" as RSL generation function.
5) Launch the GridWay daemon from $GW_LOCATION/bin/gwd.
6) Test it and enjoy!

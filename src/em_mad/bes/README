===== WELCOME =====

OGSA-BES (Open Grid Services Architecture-Basic Execution Service) 
describes a Web services-based interface that is standardized by the OGF 
(Open Grid Forum) and consists of a well-defined state model of 
computational jobs. Jobs are specified using JSDL (Job Submission 
Description Language), which is also an OGF standard.

This source distribution provides an Execution Manager Middleware Access 
Driver (EM MAD) for the OGSA-BES interface. In order to provide an 
abstraction with the resource management middleware layer, GridWay uses 
this MAD module to submit, control and monitor the execution of jobs 
according to the OGSA-BES standard. It supports GridSAM and UNICORE as target 
implementations of the OGSA-BES interface.


===== REQUIREMENTS =====

The source distribution requires on the client-side:

- GridWay 5.14 (http://www.gridway.org)
- GridSAM Schema 2.3.0 (gridsam-schema-2.3.0.jar) 
- xmlbeans, axis, wsdl4j, log4j and xalan-j2

Just for GridSAM as target OGSA-BES interface:

- Access to a MyProxy server. Access data must be placed in the 
$HOME/.myproxy file, where the first line is the hostname of the MyProxy 
server, the second line is the username and the last line is the password.


===== INSTALLATION =====

This install procedure assumes that you have installed GridWay and you 
have access to a GridSAM server.

1) Install the required software.
2) Change to src/em_mad/bes directory in the GridWay distribution.
3) Change the JAVA_EXT variable, if needed, in Makefile and gw_em_mad_bes.sh.
4) Build and install the driver executing "make; make install".
5) Configure GridWay through the $GW_LOCATION/etc/gwd.conf file (check 
the GridWay Configuration Guide) to use the MAD. This EM MAD is intended 
to work with the "dummy" TM MAD. It must be configured for using a GridFTP 
server to interface with GridSAM instances, or a GASS insecure server to 
interface with UNICORE instances.
Use "jsdl" as RSL generation function.
6) Configure the crypto.properties file in $GW_LOCATION/etc/.
7) Launch the GridWay daemon from $GW_LOCATION/bin/gwd.
8) Test it and enjoy!

This driver uses transport-level security, while message-level security is not
supported.

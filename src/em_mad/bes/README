===== WELCOME =====

OGSA-BES (Open Grid Services Architecture-Basic Execution Service) 
describes a Web services-based interface that is standardized by the OGF 
(Open Grid Forum) and consists of a well-defined state model of 
computational jobs. Jobs are specified using JSDL (Job Submission 
Description Language), which is also an OGF standard.

This source distribution provides an Execution Manager Middleware Access 
Driver (EM MAD) for the OGSA-BES interface. In order to provide an 
abstraction with the resource management middleware layer, GridWay uses 
this MAD module to submit, control and monitor the execution of jobs 
according to the OGSA-BES standard. GridSAM is used as target 
implementation of the OGSA-BES interface.


===== REQUIREMENTS =====

The source distribution requires on the server-side:

- GridSAM 2.3.0 or higher (http://www.omii.ac.uk/wiki/GridSAM). This 
must be configured with OMII WS-Security.
- A GridFTP client such as globus-url-copy.
- Access to a MyProxy server.

The source distribution requires on the client-side:

- GridWay 5.7 (http://www.gridway.org).
- The JAR files gridsam-schema-2.3.0.jar, gridsam-core-2.3.0.jar, 
omii-security-utils-1.3.jar and wss4j-1.5.0-itinnov-2.jar from GridSAM.
- Apache AXIS 1.4-6 or higher (http://ws.apache.org/axis).
- XMLBeans 2.4.0-0 or higher (http://xmlbeans.apache.org).
- The Logging Component 1.1.1-7 or higher 
(http://commons.apache.org/logging).
- The Discovery Component 0.4-3 or higher 
(http://commons.apache.org/discovery).
- The Web Services Description Language for Java Toolkit 1.6.2-2 or 
higher (http://wsdl4j.sourceforge.net).
- The Jakarta Commons HTTPClient library 3.1-9 
(http://archive.apache.org/dist/httpcomponents/commons-httpclient).
- Commons Codec 1.4-2 or higher (http://commons.apache.org/codec).
- DOM4J 1.6.1 or higher (http://dom4j.sourceforge.net).
- Xalan-Java 2.7.1-5 or higher (http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j).
- Apache XML Security 1.4.4 or higher (http://santuario.apache.org).
- A GridFTP server. 
- Access to a MyProxy server.


===== INSTALL =====

This install procedure assumes that you have installed GridWay and you 
have access to a GridSAM server.

1) Install the required packages and get the necessary JAR files of 
GridSAM.
2) Enter the downloaded directory, either after uncompression or svn 
check out. 
3) Change the variables, JAR_FILES and GRIDSAM_HOME, as needed in 
Makefile and gw_em_mad_bes.sh. 
4) Build and install the driver executing "make; make install".
5) Configure GridWay through the $GW_LOCATION/etc/gwd.conf file (check 
the GridWay Configuration Guide) to use the MAD. This EM MAD is intended 
to work with the "dummy" TM MAD configured for using a GridFTP server. 
Use "jsdl" as RSL generation function.
6) Enter in $GW_LOCATION/lib/conf directory.
7) Get and configure the client-config.wsdd to support OMII WS-Security. 
Change also the transport tag to: 

<transport name="http" pivot="java:org.apache.axis.transport.http.HTTPSender"/>

A client-config.wsdd example can be obtained from GridSAM client. 
8) Get a valid JKS certificate and copy it into $GW_LOCATION/lib/conf.
9) Configure crypto.properties with the location of the certificate, 
alias and password. Copy it into $GW_LOCATION/lib/conf.
10) Launch the GridWay daemon from $GW_LOCATION/bin/gwd.
11) On the server-side, be sure that BES is configured with OMII 
WS-Security (see <TOMCAT_DIR>/webapps/gridsam/WEB-INF/server-config.wsdd 
from GridSAM server or contact the sysadmin). Moreover, be sure that 
$GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable is set at the GridSAM service.
12) Test it and enjoy!

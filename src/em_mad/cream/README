===== WELCOME =====

CREAM (Computing Resource Execution And Management) is a simple, 
lightweight service for job management. It is part of the gLite 
middleware, and it is currently used as the official job submission 
interface on EGI. CREAM uses JDL (Job Definition Language) to describe 
jobs.

This source distribution provides an Execution Manager Middleware Access 
Driver (EM MAD) for the CREAM interface.


===== REQUIREMENTS =====

The source distribution requires on the client-side:

- GridWay 5.7 (http://www.gridway.org)
- gLite 3.2 UI
- log4cpp-devel, libxml2-devel and gsoap-devel packages


===== INSTALLATION =====

This install procedure assumes that you have installed GridWay on a gLite
UI and you have access to a CREAM CE.

1) Install the required packages.
2) Change to src/em_mad/cream directory in the GridWay distribution.
3) Add /opt/lib/c-ares to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
4) Create the Globus build environment with:

gpt-build -force -nosrc -buildir=/tmp/globus_core.$$ gcc64dbg

5) Build and install the driver executing "make; make install".
6) Configure GridWay through the $GW_LOCATION/etc/gwd.conf file (check 
the GridWay Configuration Guide) to use the MAD. This EM MAD is intended 
to work with the "dummy" TM MAD configured for using a GridFTP or GASS 
server on the client. Use "jdl" as RSL generation function.
7) Launch the GridWay daemon from $GW_LOCATION/bin/gwd.
8) Test it and enjoy!

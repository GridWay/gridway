        GridWay is an effort undergoing incubation at Globus. Incubation is
        required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates
        that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
        have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful Globus
        projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of
        the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
        project has yet to be fully endorsed by Globus.

<title>
    Grid Application Developer with DRMAA Key Concepts
</title>
  <sect1>
  <title>
    Programming Model
  </title>
  <para>

  One of the most important aspects of Grid Computing is its potential ability
  to execute distributed communicating jobs. The Distributed Resource Management
  Application API (DRMAA) specification constitutes a homogeneous interface to
  different Distributed Resource Management Systems (DRMS) to handle job
  submission, monitoring and control, and retrieval of finished job status.
  </para>

  <para>
  In this way, DRMAA could aid scientists and engineers to express their
  computational problems by providing a portable direct interface to DRMS. There
  are several projects underway to implement the DRMAA specification on
  different DRMS, like Sun Grid Engine (SGE), Condor or Torque.
  </para>

  <para>
  GridWay provides a full-featured native implementation of the DRMAA standard
  to interface DRMS through the Globus Toolkit. The GridWay DRMAA library can
  successfully compile and execute the DRMAA test suite (version 1.4.0).
  Please check the GridWay DRMAA Reference Guide for a complete description of the DRMAA
  routines.
  </para>

  <para>
  Although DRMAA could interface with DRMS at different levels, for example at
  the intranet level with SGE or Condor, with GridWay we will only consider its
  application at Grid level. In this way, the DRMS (GridWay in our case) will
  interact with the local job managers (Condor, PBS, SGE...) through the Grid
  middleware (Globus). This development and execution scheme with DRMAA, GridWay
  and Globus is depicted in the next figure.

  <sect1>
    <title>Application Profiles</title>
    <para>
     DRMAA allows scientists and engineers to express their computational
     problems in a Grid environment. The capture of the job exit code allows
     users to define complex jobs, where each depends on the output and exit
     code from the previous job. They may even involve branching, looping and
     spawning of subtasks, allowing the exploitation of the parallelism
     on the workflow of certain type of applications.
     Let's review some typical scientific application profiles that can benefit
     from DRMAA.
    </para>

    <para>
    Applications that can be obviously divided into a number of independent
    tasks. The application is asynchronous when require distinct instruction
    streams and so different execution times. A sample of this schema
    with its DRMAA implementation is showed in the following figure.

   A Master task assigns a description (input less) of the task to be performed
   by each Worker. Once all the Workers are completed, the Master task performs
   some computations in order to evaluate a stop criterion or to assign new
   tasks to more workers. Again, it could be synchronous or asynchronous. The
   following figure shows a example of Master-worker optimization loop and a
   DRMAA implementation sample.

<chapter><title> DRMAA Programming Howto</title>
  <para>
  This section is a tutorial for getting started programming DRMAA applications
  with GridWay. Although is not necessary that you already know how GridWay
  works, prior experience submitting and controlling jobs with GridWay will come
  in handy. This tutorial shows the use of the most important functions in the
  DRMAA standard (around 6), and gives you some hints to use the GridWay DRMAA
  library.
  </para>
  <para>
  The source code for the following examples can be found in
  the <filename>$GW_LOCATION/examples</filename> directory.
  </para>
  <sect1><title>DRMAA Sessions</title>
    <para>
    Let us start with the initialization steps of every DRMAA program. Before
    any call to a DRMAA function you must start a DRMAA session. The session
    is used to manage the jobs submitted in your Grid application. Before ending
    the program you should disengage from the previously started session, to
    free the internal session structures.
    </para>

    <para>
    Also, as you will see every DRMAA function returns an error code that allows
    you to check whether the call was successfull or not (DRMAA_ERRNO_SUCCESS,
    if everything goes well). Through out this tutorial, for the  shake of
    clarity, we will get rid of error checking code in most cases.
    But remember that you should check return codes.
    </para>

    <para>
    The following example shows you how to manage a DRMAA session. It also shows
    some information about the DRMAA implementation and the DRMS you are using.

    drmaa_init() is the first DRMAA function in a DRMAA program, and must be
    called only once per DRMAA program. Almost every DRMAA function uses to
    special arguments for error reporting pourposes: a string buffer (error),
    and its length (DRMAA_ERROR_STRING_BUFFER-1). As you can see DRMAA has
    some predefined buffer sizes for char * variables that you can use,
    although they are not mandatory.
    </para>

    <para>
    The first parameter of the drmaa_init() function is an implementation
    dependent string which may be used to specify which DRM system to use. In
    the GridWay library it can be used to select which GW daemon you
    want to connect to, NULL means the default option, localhost.

  <sect1><title>Job Template Compilation</title>
  <para>
  So we already have an active session, how do we use it to submit jobs. The
  first thing to do is to provide a description of your job. A job is
  described by its job template (a drmaa_job_template_t variable), which in
  turns is a structure to store information about your job (things like the
  executable, its arguments or the output files).
  </para>

  <para>
  The DRMAA standard provides several pre-defined strings to refer to common job
  template attributes (those staring with DRMAA_ like DRMAA_REMOTE_COMMAND).
  The GridWay library also defines some macros to refer to  GridWay specific
  attributes (those staring with DRMAA_GW_ like DRMAA_GW_INPUT_FILES).
  </para>
  <para>
  There are two kind of attributes: scalar and vector. Scalar attributes are
  simple strings (char *) and corresponds to template attributes in the form:
    <screen>
 attrbitue = value
    </screen>
  </para>
  <para>
  You can use the drmaa_set_attribute() and drmaa_get_attr_value() to manage
  these scalar attributes. On the other hand, vector attributes corresponds to
  job template variables with one or more values i.e:
  <screen>
 attrbitue = value1 value2 ... valueN
  </screen>
  </para>
  <para>
  A vector attribute is NULL terminated array of strings (char **). You can use
  the drmaa_set_vector_attribute() and drmaa_get_next_attr_value() to deal with
  vector attributes.
  </para>

  <para>
  We will use a common job template for the rest of the tutorial, so we will
  make a function to set up this job template. Remember to check the return
  codes of the DRMAA functions.

  Bulk jobs are a direct way to express parametric computations. A bulk job is
  a set of independent (and very similar) tasks that use the same job template.
  You can use the DRMAA_PLACEHOLDER_INCR constat to assign different
  input/output files for each task. The DRMAA_PLACEHOLDER_INCR is a unique
  identifier of each job (task) in the bulk (array) job. In the GridWay DRMAA
  library it corresponds to the ${TASK_ID} parameter.

    <para>
    This is a well known exercise. For our purposes, we will calculate the
    integral of the following function f(x) = 4/(1+x2). So, &pi; will be the
    integral of f(x) in the interval [0,1].
    </para>

    <para>
    In order to calculate the whole integral, it's interesting to divide the
    function in several tasks and compute its area. The following program
    computes the area of a set of intervals, asigned to a given task:

    <title>Setting up the job template</title>

    <para>
    Let us start with the definition of each tasks. As you can see, the
    previous program needs the number of intervals, total tasks, and the task
    number. These variables are available to compile job templates through
    the DRMAA_GW_TASK_ID and DRMAA_GW_TOTAL_TASKS predefined strings.
    </para>

    <para>
    Also, each task must generate a different standard output file, with its
    partial result. We can use the standard DRMAA_PLACEHOLDER_INCR predefined
    string to set up different filenames for each task, so they will not
    overwrite each others output.

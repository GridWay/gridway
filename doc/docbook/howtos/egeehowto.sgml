<title>Integration of GridWay within the EGEE Infrastructure</title>

    <para>
    GridWay is an open-source component for meta-scheduling in the Grid
    Ecosystem. GridWay gives end users, application developers and managers of
    Grid infrastructures a <ulink
    url="http://www.gridway.org/doku.php?id=about:functionality">scheduling
    functionality</ulink> similar to that found on local DRM  (Distributed
    Resource Management) systems. </para>

    <para> GridWay is completely
    functional on EGEE, being able to interface with the computing, file
    transferring and information services available within the EGEE
    infrastructure. GridWay does not intend to substitute the resource brokers
    available in the EGEE distribution (gLite-WMS and LCG-RB), but to provide a
    meta-scheduling alternative with greater functionality and higher
    performance for given application profiles. GridWay is being successfully
    used in the <ulink
    url="http://grid.bifi.unizar.es/egee/fusion-vo/contact.html">NA4 Fusion
    activities</ulink>. GridWay is being tested under <ulink
    url="http://etics.web.cern.ch">ETICS</ulink>, the eInfraestructure for
    Testing, Integration and Configuration of Software of the EGEE project.
    </para> <para> This section of the GridWay web page only provides relevant
    information about installing and configuring GridWay on the EGEE
    infrastructure. For general information about GridWay, please refer to the
    <ulink url="http://www.gridway.org">GridWay main page</ulink>.

        <listitem>
        <para>
        Before unpacking the distribution, in order to prepare
        the environment, execute (as root) the following:

        <filename>globus-build-env-$GLOBUS_FLAVOR_NAME.sh</filename> and

				<listitem>
				<para>
					Compiling GridWay in an EGEE UI had some problems in the past as the gridftp
					implementation installed in this machines lacked some functions needed by the
					gridftp transfer mad used by GridWay. It also lacks Globus WS libray support (GT4)
					so Web Services execution mad can not be built here. Fortunately these mads are not
					used to interact with EGEE resources as home directories in this clusters are not
					shared and WN does not necessarily need to have external connection, Pre Web
					Services execution mad is used to talk to CE's and the dummy transfer mad is used to
					transfer files. You can now disable gridftp mad building using
					<option>--disable-gridftp</option> and ws mad with <option>--disable-ws</option> so
					you can compile GridWay in an EGEE UI and use it to manage EGEE resources. The only
					caveat is that you can not use gridftp transfer mad with other non EGEE resources or
					interact with Web Services enabled resources. If you want to have this functionality
					you have to install GT4 by yourself and use this installation to compile and run
					GridWay.

<title>Configuration to access to EGEE resources</title>

    <para>
    The GridWay <ulink url="http://www.gridway.org/documentation/stable/admin/">
    System Administrator's guide</ulink> provides complete information
    about configuration of the meta-scheduler. Next steps describe the specific
    configuration of the access drivers for the EGEE infrastructure services
    (LCG).

TM_MAD = dummy:gw_tm_mad_dummy:-g
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
    There are two options for the configuration of the TM MAD:

        <para>
        <option>-g</option>: starts a GASS server.

        <listitem>
        <para>
        <option>-u</option>: specifies the URL of a GridFTP server running in
        the client. For example:
        <screen>
TM_MAD = dummy:gw_tm_mad_dummy:-u gsiftp\://cepheus.dacya.ucm.es
</screen>
        </para>
           </listitem>

    <para>
    There are two options for VO management:
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
        <para>
        It is possible to configure a GridWay instance to only use those queues
        authorized to your VO by filtering them. This is done with option
        <option>-q</option> of the IM MAD. For example (in
        <filename>gwd.conf</filename>):
        <screen>
IM_MAD = mds2_glue:gw_im_mad_mds2_glue:-l etc/im_examples/host_glue.list
-q (GlueCEAccessControlBaseRule=VO\:fusion):dummy:prews_nsh
</screen>
        </para>
        <para>
        Change "fusion" with the VO you belong to.
        </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>
        The other possibility is to use the parameter QUEUE_ACCESS in the
        requirement expression of a job. This parameter is set to the list of
        authorized VOs, each one between colons:
        <screen>
            QUEUE_ACCESS = ":fusion::dteam:"
</screen>
        For example (in the Job Template or job_template.default):
            <screen>
            REQUIREMENTS = QUEUE_ACCESS = "*:fusion:*"</screen>
        to only use those queues authorized for "fusion" VO, or
            <screen>
            REQUIREMENTS = QUEUE_ACCESS = "" | QUEUE_ACCESS = "*:fusion:*"
</screen>
        if you also want to use those queues with no access restrictions.
        </para>
        <warning>
        <para>
        Make sure of using at least one of the above control access alternatives
        in order to not cause a lot of authorization failures.

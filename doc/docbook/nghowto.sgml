<title>Integration of GridWay within the Nordugrid Infrastructure</title>

    <para>
    GridWay is an open-source component for meta-scheduling in the Grid
    Ecosystem. GridWay gives end users, application developers and managers of
    Grid infrastructures a <ulink
    url="http://www.gridway.org/about/functionality.php"> scheduling
    functionality</ulink> similar to that found on local DRM  (Distributed
    Resource Management) systems.

<chapter>
<title>Installation on a Nordugrid UI</title>

    <para>
	The installation needs to have previously installed Nordugrid (ARC) client
	software. Specifically version 6.x. This software and instructions on how to
	install it can be found at <ulink url="http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/ng-client-install.html">Nordugrid client installation instructions</ulink>.
    </para>

    <para>
    The <ulink url="http://www.gridway.org/documentation/guides.php">GridWay
    Installation and Configuration Guide</ulink> provides complete information
    about installation of the meta-scheduler. Next steps illustrate specific
    aspects for installation of GridWay alongside Nordugrid drivers:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
	
        <listitem>
        <para>
        When invoking the <command>configure</command> command, make sure you add
        the option <option>--enable-nordugrid</option>.
        </para>
        </listitem>

		<listitem>
		<para>
		If you are not going to use WS-Gram and you do not have globus installed
		in the machine you are configuring then you have to disable this mads with
		<option>--disable-ws</option> and <option>--disable-gridftp</option> when
		invoking <command>configure</command> script.
		</para>
		</listitem>

        <listitem>
        <para>
        For a multi-user installation, the <filename>sudoers</filename> file of the
        <command>sudo</command> command must include also Nordugrid drivers:
        <screen>
gwadmin ALL=(GW_USERS) NOPASSWD: $GW_LOCATION/bin/gw_em_mad_nordugrid *
gwadmin ALL=(GW_USERS) NOPASSWD: $GW_LOCATION/bin/gw_tm_mad_nordugrid *</screen>
        </para>
        </listitem>

<chapter>
<title>Configuration to access to Nordugrid resources</title>

    <para>
    The <ulink url="http://www.gridway.org/documentation/guides.php">GridWay
    Installation and Configuration Guide</ulink> provides complete information
    about configuration of the meta-scheduler. Next steps describe the specific
    configuration of the access drivers for the Nordugrid infrastructure services.
   </para>

    <para>
    In file <filename>$GW_LOCATION/etc/gwd.conf</filename>:
    <screen width='80'>
IM_MAD = nginfo:gw_im_mad_static:-l etc/nordugrid.list:nordugridftp:nordugrid
EM_MAD = nordugrid:gw_em_mad_nordugrid::xrsl
TM_MAD = nordugridftp:gw_tm_mad_nordugrid:
</screen>
    </para>

	<para>
	Nodes list (etc/nordugrid.list) is a list of nodes and files with static
	static information of each node, this is an example:
	</para>

	<screen>
&lt;hostname1&gt; etc/&lt;hostname1&gt;.machine
&lt;hostname2&gt; etc/&lt;hostname2&gt;.machine
&lt;hostname3&gt; etc/&lt;hostname3&gt;.machine
...</screen>

	<para>
	To collect a list of nodes where you are allowed to send jobs you can issue this
	command:
	</para>
	
	<screen>
$ ngtest -R</screen>

	<para>
	The list of hosts that this commands outputs are the ones you have to add to the
	file. You also have to know what queues does each host have so you can
	select one to send to. To know available queues for each node you can create a
	file with all this hosts (one hostname per line) and issue this command:
	</para>
		
	<screen>
$ ngstat -C &lt;name_of_the_list_file&gt; -q</screen>

	<para>
	When this list now you can generate each file with static information for
	each node (that will be listed from nordugrid.list file). I'll provide here a
	template that you have to change for each node. Make sure you change important
	information about each node (&lt;hostname&gt;, &lt;slots&gt; and
	&lt;queuename&gt;). Make sure to change every &lt;queuename&gt;. Note that this
	file contains two lines, one starting with "HOSTNAME=" and the other with
	"QUEUE_NAME[0]=".
	</para>

	<para>
	If nordugrid client environment is not automatically configured you also have to
	do so in $GW_LOCATION/etc/gwrc and add this lines and put your nordugrid client
	path accordingly:
	</para>
		
	<screen>
CURRENT_DIR=$PWD
cd &lt;nordugrid_client_path&gt;
. ./setup.sh
cd $CURRENT_DIR</screen>

    <title>Using GridWay</title>

    <para>
    The functionality and interfaces provided by GridWay are independent from
    the underlying Grid infrastructure. Please refer to the guides (user guide,
    command reference, programming guide...) available at <ulink

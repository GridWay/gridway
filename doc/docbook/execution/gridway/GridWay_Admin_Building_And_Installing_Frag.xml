  <title>Verifying Globus Installation</title>

    <para>
    As GridWay relies on Globus services, it is assumed that a Globus grid
    infrastructure has been installed and configured. You can perform the
    following tests to verify your Globus pre-WS installation, and to
    ensure that it will work with GridWay:

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
        <para>
        Authorization test:
        <screen>$ globusrun -a -r localhost</screen>
        You should receive the message "GRAM Authentication test successful".
        </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
        <para>
        Submission test:
        <screen>$ globus-job-run localhost /bin/uname -a</screen>
        You should see the output of the "/bin/uname -a" command.
        </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
        <para>
        File transfer test:

$ globus-url-copy file:///etc/hosts gsiftp://localhost/tmp/hosts1</screen>
        <screen>
$ globus-url-copy gsiftp://localhost/tmp/hosts1 file:///tmp/hosts2</screen>
        The contents of files /etc/hosts, /tmp/hosts1 and /tmp/hosts2 should be identical.
        </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
        <para>
        Information retrieval test:
        <screen>
$ grid-info-search -x</screen>
        You should see a lot of information in LDIF format.
        </para>
        </listitem>

    Change localhost to the name of the host your want to test.

    and to ensure that it will work with GridWay:

        Submission test:
        <screen>$ globusrun-ws -submit -F localhost -s -c /bin/uname -a</screen>
        You should see the output of the "/bin/uname -a" command (along with
        other information about submission progress).

$ globus-url-copy gsiftp://localhost/tmp/hosts1 file:///tmp/hosts2</screen>
         The contents of files /etc/hosts, /tmp/hosts1 and /tmp/hosts2 should be identical.
        </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
        <para>
        Information retrieval test:
        <screen>
$ wsrf-query -x -s https://localhost:8443/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService</screen>
        You should see a lot of information in XML format.

                          <para>         
                                XML documents from wsrf-query should not contain any DEBUG messages. SOAP Message Logging for the client tools has to be disabled in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/log4j.properties.

        <para>
                If a binary distribution of the Globus Toolkit is installed, you may be required to manually install <emphasis>globus_core</emphasis> (used to detect the compiler and platform settings of the computer that the Toolkit is installed on). The following command can be used to perform this operation:
                <screen>
                        $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build -nosrc &lt;flavor&gt;

      You can install GridWay in two different ways:
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
        <para>
        <emphasis>Single-user installation</emphasis>. GridWay will be installed
        configured and executed by each user. In this case, neither the
        installation nor the configuration require priveledge access to the
        system. This installation mode will be useful if you  want to set up a
        personal queue, or for testing purposes.
        </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>
        <emphasis>Multiple-user installation</emphasis>. GridWay will be
        installed, and configured by the system manager. Regular users are able
        to submit, control and monitor their jobs  from a front-end
        (GridWay server host) or from client hosts. This installation mode is
        recommended for production use.

  <title>Multiple-User Mode Installation</title>

  <para>
  In this scenario, the installation of GridWay is performed by the system
  manager and the users are able to submit, control and monitor their jobs
  from a front-end (GridWay server host) or from client hosts, which may not
  require a GridWay/Globus installation.  This means that there is one GridWay
  installation for each organization that provides support for multiple
  intra-organization users.
  </para>

  <important>
    <para>
      The instructions here described assumes that you are going to install
      GridWay in its own directory ($GW_LOCATION, e.g.
      <filename>/usr/local/gw</filename>). Also it is assumed that the
      installation, configuration and service execution will be performed by
      an special account (<filename>gwadmin</filename>).
    </para>
    <para>
      GridWay can be also installed within the Globus Toolkit tree. To do this you have
      to use the flag <option>--enable-globus-scheme</option> when calling
      configure script and set the prefix to <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION</filename>.
      In this case, the <filename>gwadmin</filename> user will be the user
      account that performed the Globus Toolkit installation.
    </para>
    <para>
       When you install it this way you also have to note that
       <filename>$GW_LOCATION/var</filename> and <filename>$GW_LOCATION/etc</filename>
       directories will be <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/gridway</filename> and
       <filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gridway</filename>.
    </para>
  </important>

  <important>
  <para>
  Note that GridWay daemon SHOULD NOT be run as root. Only part of the
  installation will require privileged access.

  </important>

  <para>
  Login as root account and follow the next steps:
    <orderedlist>

    <listitem>
    <para>
		All of the GridWay users must be members of the same UNIX group,
    <filename>&lt;gwgroup></filename>. We recommend to create a new
    group (call <filename>gwusers</filename>, for example), and assure that
    all GridWay user accounts are members of this new group.
    </para>
    </listitem>

	  <listitem>
    <para>
    The GridWay administrator account, <filename>&lt;adminuser></filename>,
    can be an existing administrative login or a new login. We recommend
    creating a new account for the GridWay administration user
    (call <filename>gwadmin</filename>, for example). This account will own
    all of the files in the GridWay installation, all of the daemons in the
    GridWay execution and it can be used to configure GridWay once it is
    installed. Primary group of <filename>&lt;adminuser></filename>
    should be <filename>&lt;gwgroup></filename>.

    DO NOT use root account for the  GridWay administrator account.

    <para>
    Usually <command>sudo</command> clears all environment variables for
    security reasons. However MADs need the <command>GW_LOCATION</command>
    and <command>GLOBUS_LOCATION</command> variables to be set. To preserve
    those variables in the MAD environment, add the following line to your
    <filename>sudoers</filename> file:
    <screen>Defaults>GW_USERS env_keep="GW_LOCATION GLOBUS_LOCATION"</screen>
    </para>
    <para>
    The following line <emphasis>shouldn't</emphasis> be in the sudoers file, otherwise gridway could not use sudo as it will ask for a tty:

    </para>
    <para>
    To test the <command>sudo</command> command configuration try to execute a

  <para>
  Following previous steps, the end-users must login to the GridWay server host
  to be able to execute GridWay commands and use the DRMAA libraries.
  </para>

  <para>
  Additionally, client hosts, that are not required to have GridWay/Globus
  installed, could be deployed to remotely interface to the GridWay server host.
  In such a case, user accounts and home directories must be shared between
  the GridWay server and the client hosts, via for example NIS and NFS; and
  <filename>&lt;gwlocation> </filename> directory should be readable on all
  client hosts. The  <filename>&lt;gwlocation> </filename> directory may be
  available via for example NFS by exporting
  <filename>&lt;gwlocation></filename> from GridWay server,
  creating <filename>&lt;gwlocation></filename>  directory in the client
  hosts, changing its ownership to
  <filename>&lt;adminuser>:&lt;gwgroup></filename>  and mounting the
  <filename>&lt;gwlocation></filename>  directory exported by the GridWay server
  on the <filename>&lt;gwlocation></filename> of the client hosts.

  Following those steps, a user logged in a client hosts is able to interface
  to the GridWay daemon in the GridWay server host. However, the
  <command>grid-proxy-init</command> globus command must be executed in the
  server host in order to create a proxy by, for example, executing
  <filename>  ssh &lt;GridWay server> grid-proxy-init </filename> .

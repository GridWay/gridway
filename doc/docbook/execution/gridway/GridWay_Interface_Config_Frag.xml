            GridWay requires that the environment variables GLOBUS_LOCATION and GW_LOCATION are set. 
            These are set to the base of your Globus installation and GridWay installation. In GT &version;, GridWay is installed in the same place as Globus, 
            so you can set both of these environment variables to the same location.

                Note that the GridWay daemon SHOULD NOT be run as root. Only part of the 
                installation will require privileged access.

                    We recommend creating a new group (called <filename>gwusers</filename>, for example), and make sure that 
                    all GridWay user accounts are members of this new group.

                    all of the files in the GridWay installation plus all of the daemons in the GridWay execution and it can be used to 
                    configure GridWay once it is installed. Primary group of <filename>&lt;adminuser></filename> should be

                    variables to be set. To preserve those variables in the MAD environment, add the following line to your

                recovered. This includes, for jobs in wrapper state, contacting with the

    <section><title>Scheduler Configuration Guide</title>
        
        <para>
            Grid scheduling consists of finding a suitable (in terms of a
            given target) assignment between a computational workload (jobs) and
            computational resources. The scheduling problem has been thoroughly studied in
            the past and efficient algorithms have been devised for different computing
            platforms. Although some of the experience gained in scheduling can be
            applied to the Grid, it presents some characteristics that differ dramatically
            from classical computing platforms (i.e. clusters or MPPs), namely: different
            administration domains, limited control over resources, heterogeneity and
            dynamism.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Grid scheduling is an active research area. The Grid scheduling problem is
            better understood today and several heuristics, performance models and
            algorithms have been proposed and evaluated with the aid of simulation tools.
            However, current working Grid schedulers are only based on match-making, and
            barely consider multi-user environments.

        <para>
            In this section, we describe the state-of-the-art scheduling policies
            implemented in the GridWay system. The contents of this guide reflect the
            experience obtained since GridWay version 4, and a strong feedback from
            the GridWay user community.

            <title> GridWay Scheduling Architecture </title>
            <para>
                The scheduler is responsible for assigning jobs to Grid resources; therefore,
                it decides when and where to run a job. These decisions are made periodically in
                an endless loop. The frequency of the scheduler interventions can be adjusted
                with the <envar>SCHEDULER_INTERVAL</envar> configuration parameter (see
                <olink targetptr='GWDconf'/>).

            <para>
                In order to make job to resource assignments the scheduler receives
                information from the following sources (see <olink targetptr='schedinfo'/>):

                            jobs as well as running jobs (those in wrapper state). Those jobs that
                            cannot be started are filtered out from the list, i.e., jobs with unmet
                            dependencies, stopped or held.

                            static or dynamic, see <olink targetptr='InfDrivConf'/>. This information is
                            used by the GridWay core to build a list of suitable resources for each
                            job, i.e., resources meeting the job requirements, and to compute their rank.

                until all jobs are dispatched, and those that could not be assigned wait for the

                A scheduling policy is used to assign a <emphasis>dispatch priority

                each resource. Therefore, a Grid scheduling policy comprises two components:

                            a given scheduling domain (GridWay instance). Note that these policies
                            are only enforced in the scheduling domain and not for the whole Grid
                            infrastructure as discussed above.

                            executed on those resources that match its requirements. The resource
                            policies are used to sort the matching resource list of each job. The
                            matching resources are prioritized according to four policies: fixed, usage,
                            failure and rank. Note that these policies do not only depend on the
                            Grid resource but also on the job owner, as each Grid user (or VO member)
                            has its own access rights and usage history.

                These two top-level policies can be combined to implement a wide range of

                The job prioritization policies allow Grid administrators to influence the
                dispatch order of the jobs, that is, to decide which job is sent to the Grid.
                Traditionally, DRMS implement different policies based on the owner of the job,
                the resources consumed by each user or the requirements of the job. Some of
                these scheduling strategies can be directly applied in a Grid, while others must
                be adapted because of their unique characteristics: dynamism, heterogeneity, high
                fault rate and site autonomy.

                    from 00 (lowest priority) to 19 (highest priority), so jobs with a
                    higher priority will be dispatched first. The default priority values are
                    assigned, by the Grid administrator, using the following criteria:

                <para>
                    The fair-share policy allows you to establish a dispatching ratio among the users of a
                    scheduling domain. For example, a fair-share policy could establish that jobs
                    from David and Alice must be dispatched to the Grid in a 2:5 ratio. In this
                    case, the scheduler tracks the jobs submitted to the Grid by these two users
                    and dispatches the jobs so they target a 2:5 ratio of job submissions.
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    This policy resembles the well-known fair-share of traditional LRMS. However,
                    note that what GridWay users share is the ability to submit a job to the Grid
                    and not resource usage. Resource usage share cannot be imposed at a Grid level,
                    as Grid resources are shared with other Grid users and with local users
                    from the remote organization. In addition, the set of resources that can be
                    potentially used by each user is not homogeneous, as each user may belong to
                    a different VO.

                <para>
                    GridWay tracks the jobs submitted to the Grid by the users over time.
                    Grid administrators can  specify a timeframe over which user submissions
                    are evaluated. The amount of time considered by GridWay is defined by a
                    number of time intervals  (<envar>SH_WINDOW_DEPTH</envar>) and the duration of each one
                    (<envar>SH_WINDOW_SIZE</envar>, in days). The effective number of submissions in a
                    given window is exponentially damped, so present events become more relevant.

                    policy can be found in most of the DRMS today. In GridWay, the priority of a

                    Grid administrators should provide a way to qualify the remaining time to reach

            <title>Resource Prioritization Policies</title>
            <para>
                The resource prioritization policies allow Grid administrators to influence
                the usage of resources made by the users, that is, decide where to run a job.
                Usually, in classical DRMS, this resource usage is administered by means of
                the queue concept.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                In GridWay, the scheduler builds a <emphasis>meta-queue</emphasis> (a queue
                consisting of the local queues of the Grid resources) for each job based on
                its requirements (e.g.,  operating system or architecture). Note that this
                <emphasis>meta-queue</emphasis> is not only built in terms of resource
                properties but is also based upon the owner of the job, (as each Grid user may
                belong to a different VO with its own access rights and usage privileges).
            </para>
            
            <para>
                The <emphasis>meta-queue</emphasis> for a job consists of the queues of those
                resources that meet the job requirements specified in the job template and
                have at least one free slot. By default, this queue is sorted in a
                first-discovered first-used fashion. This order can be influenced by means of
                the subsequent resource prioritization policies.

                <para>
                    Usually, GridWay is configured with several Information Managers (IM). Grid
                    administrators can prioritize resources based upon the IM that discovered
                    the resource. Grid administrators can also assign priorities
                    to individual resources. For example, a fixed priority policy can specify that
                    resources from the intranet (managed by an IM driver tagged
                    <command>intranet</command>) should always be used before resources from
                    other sites (managed by an IM driver tagged <command>grid</command>).
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    The priority of a resource ranges from 01 (lowest priority) to 99 (highest
                    priority), so resources with a higher priority will be used first. Grid
                    administrators can also prioritize individual resources based on business
                    decisions.
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    When a resource gets the priority value 00, it becomes a
                    <emphasis role="bold">banned resource</emphasis>, and will not be used for
                    any job. So Grid administrators can virtually <emphasis>unplug</emphasis>
                    resources from their scheduling domain.

                    time or network transfer times, are considered when scheduling a job. This
                    policy is derived from the sum of two contributions: history and current.

            These drivers are configured and selected via the GWD configuration interface
            described in <olink targetptr='GWDconf'/>. Additionally you may need to configure
            your environment (see <olink targetdoc="gridwayAdmin" targetptr="s-gridway-admin-testing"/>) in order to successfully
            load the MADs into the GWD core. To do so, you can also use global and per user
            environment configuration files (<filename>gwrc</filename>).

            <para>
                There is one global config file and per user configuration files that can be used to set
                environment variables for MADs. These files are standard shell scripts that are sourced
                into the MAD environment before it is loaded. It can be used, for example, to set the
                variable <envar>X509_USER_PROXY</envar> so you can have it located elsewhere instead of
                the standard place (<filename>/tmp/x509_u&lt;uid&gt;</filename>). Other variables can be
                set and you can even source other shell scripts, for instance, you can prepare another
                globus environment for MADs for some users, like this:
            </para>
            
            <screen>
    X509_USER_PROXY=$HOME/.globus/proxy.pem
    
    GLOBUS_LOCATION=/opt/globus-4.0
    . $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh</screen>
            
            <para>
                The file for global MAD environment configuration is
                <filename>$GW_LOCATION/etc/gridway/gwrc</filename> and the user specific one is
                <filename>$HOME/.gwrc</filename>.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                You have to take into account a couple of things:
            </para>
            
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        The global environment file is loaded <emphasis>before</emphasis> the user one, so the variables set by the
                        user file take precedence over the global ones.

                    <para>
                        The files are sourced so you need to export the variables to make them visible in
                        the environment of the called MAD. Right now there is a mechanism so variables set
                        as <envar>VARIABLENAME=VALUE</envar> are automatically exported (without spaces
                        preceding the variable name). If you are sourcing other files or you put variables
                        inside an indented block (for example, in an if statement) you have to explicitly
                        export them. For example:
                    </para>
                    <screen>

                    In this mode, hosts are statically discovered by reading a host list file

                    from files. Hint: Use this mode for testing purposes and not in a production
                    environment. To configure a Information Driver in SS mode use the host
                    list option, for example:

                    Hosts are discovered by reading a host list file. However, the information
                    of each host is gathered by querying its information service (GRIS in MDS2
                    or the DefaultIndexService in MDS4). Hint: Use this mode if the resources in
                    your Grid does not vary too much, i.e. resource are not added or removed
                    very often. To configure an Information Driver in SD mode, use the host
                    list option, for example:
                    <screen>IM_MAD = glue:gw_im_mad_mds2_glue:-l examples/im/host.list::gridftp:prews</screen>
                </para>
                <para>
                     In this case the host list file contains one host per line, with the format:
                    <screen>
    FQDN
    ...
    FQDN</screen>

                        You can configure your IMs to work in a dynamic monitoring mode but get
                        some static information from an attributes file (as described in the SS mode).
                        This configuration is useful when you want to add some host attributes missing from
                        the IndexService (like software availability, special hardware devices...). You can see
                        a useful use of this mode in section <olink targetdoc="gridwayAdmin" targetptr='s-gridway-admin-troubleshooting'/>.

                    In this mode, hosts are discovered and monitored by directly accessing the
                    Grid Information Service. Hint: Use this mode if the resources in your Grid
                    does vary too much, i.e. resource are added or removed very often. To
                    configure a Information Driver in SD mode, use the server option,
                    for example:
                    <screen>IM_MAD = mds4:gw_im_mad_mds4:-s hydrus.dacya.ucm.es::gridftp:ws</screen>

                <para>
                    If you are using an MDS2 information service you may need to specify the
                    Virtual Organization name in the DN of the LDIF entries
                    (<emphasis>Mds-vo-name</emphasis>) with the base option described above.

                        You can simultaneously use as many Information Drivers as you need
                        (up to 10). So GridWay allows you to simultaneously use MDS2 and MDS4
                        Services. You can also use resources from different Grids at the same time.

                <para>
                    There is a way to specify a different machine to be used as gsiftp endpoint than the one that
                    has the gatekeeper installed. This is useful when the CE machine does not
                    have gsiftp server configured but there is another machine that works as a Storage
                    Element. Right now, this information could be set statically but the rest of the
                    information can be updated dynamically. To use this feature you have to create a file
                    for each host you want to configure with extra information and another file with pairs of
                    host and file name (as described above for the SS mode).
                    The filename can be a full path or a relative path to
                    <envar>GW_LOCATION</envar>. Then in the IM MAD you must specify the list file with
                    <option>-l</option>, like this (in <filename>gwd.conf</filename>):
                </para>
                
                <screen>
   IM_MAD = mds4:gw_im_mad_mds4:-l etc/gridway/host.list:gridftp:ws</screen>
                
                <para>
                    The file list should look like this:
                </para>
                
                <screen>
   wsgram-host1.domain.com etc/gridway/wsgram-host1.attr

                <para>
                    And the attributes file for each node should look like this:

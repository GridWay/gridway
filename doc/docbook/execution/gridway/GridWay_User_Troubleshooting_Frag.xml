<title>Debugging job execution</title>

<para>
GridWay reporting and accounting facilities provide information about overall
performance and help debug job execution. GWD generates the following files
under the <filename>$GW_LOCATION/var</filename> directory:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para>
   <filename>gwd.log</filename>: System level log. You can find log
  information of the activity of the middleware access drivers; and a
  coarse-grain log information about jobs.
  </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
  <para>
  <filename>$JOB_ID/job.log</filename>: Detailed log information for each job,
  it includes details of job state transitions, resource usage and
  performance.
  </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
  <para>
  <filename>$JOB_ID/stdout.wrapper</filename>: Standard output of the wrapper
  executable.
  </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
  <para>
  <filename>$JOB_ID/stderr.wrapper</filename>: Standard error output of the
  wrapper executable. By default, wrapper is executed with shell debugging
  options (<option>-xv</option>) active, so this is usually the best source of
  information in case of failure.
  </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<title>Frequent problems</title>

<para>
Currently, many errors are handled silently and are only shown in the
<filename>job.log</filename> file.
</para>

<para>
Also, there is a number of failures related to the underlying middleware
(Globus in this case) that could make some jobs fail. It is a good idea to
perform some basic testing of Globus when some jobs unexpectedly fail
(see the <emphasis>Installation and Configuration Guide</emphasis> to learn
how to verify a Globus installation)
</para>

<para>
Use the GridWay lists (see <filename>www.gridway.org/support.php</filename>),
to submit your problems and they will be eventually appear in this guide.

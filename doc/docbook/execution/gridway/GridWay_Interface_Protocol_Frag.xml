<title>Information manager MAD</title>
        <para>
            In order to provide an abstraction with the monitoring and discovery middleware layer (or Grid Information System), GridWay uses a Middleware Access Driver (MAD) module to discover and monitor hosts. This module provides basic operations with the monitoring and discovery middleware.

<para>
The information drivers interface to the grid information services to collect the resource attributes. These attributes can be used by the end-user to set requirement and rank expressions (job template), for filtering, prioritizing and selecting the candidate hosts. GridWay can simultaneously use as many Information drivers as needed. For example, GridWay allows you to simultaneously use MDS2 and MDS4 services, so you can also use resources from different Grids at the same time. Drivers for MDS 2 and MDS 4 provide the variables described in Table 2-1. However, the information manager is able to receive from the driver other parameters. The GridWay team has used other information parameters that could be very important to improve application efficiency (HTC apps) and for job migration: BANDWIDTH, LATENCY, SPEC_INT, SPEC_FLOAT...

GridWay 5.2 includes a scheduler template
(<filename>gw_scheduler_skel.c</filename>) to develop custom schedulers.
As an example a Round-Robin/Flooding scheduler can be found in the
GridWay distribution (<filename>gw_flood_scheduler.c</filename>, in
<filename>$GW_LOCATION/src/sched/</filename>). This is a very  simple
scheduling algorithm, which maximizes the number of jobs submitted to the Grid.

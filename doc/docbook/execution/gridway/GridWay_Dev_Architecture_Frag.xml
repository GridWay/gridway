    <title>Architecture</title>
    <para>
        In GridWay 4.0.2, we introduced an architecture for the execution manager module based on a MAD (Middleware Access Driver) to interface Grid execution services. In this release we have taken advantage of this architecture to implement an information manager module with a MAD that interfaces Grid information services, and a transfer manager module with a MAD that interfaces Grid data services. Moreover, we have decoupled the scheduling process from the dispatch manager through the use of an external and selectable scheduler module.

                    <emphasis>GridWay core</emphasis> is responsible for job execution management and resource brokering providing advanced scheduling and job failure &amp; recovery capabilities. The Dispatch Manager performs all submission stages and watches over the efficient execution of the job. The Information Manager, through its MADs (Middleware Access Driver), is responsible for host discovery and monitoring. The Execution Manager, through its MADs, is responsible job execution and management. The Transfer Manager, through its MADs, is responsible for file staging, remote working directory set-up and remote host clean-up.

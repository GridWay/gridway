              GridWay is an effort undergoing incubation at Globus. Incubation is
              required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates
              that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
              have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful Globus
              projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of
              the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
              project has yet to be fully endorsed by Globus.

<title>Grid Computing Key Concepts</title>

  <sect1>
  <title>What is a Grid Infrastructure?</title>
    <para>
    <emphasis>Several Distributed Resource Management Systems (DRMS) have been
    developed to provide workload management of applications.</emphasis> These
    systems first appeared in the late eighties, coinciding with the advent of
    parallel and distributed platforms, such as high performance computing
    servers and clusters. There are a number of commercial and open source
    local workload management systems available today, such as
    <ulink url="http://www.openpbs.org/">PBS</ulink>,
    <ulink url="http://www.sun.com/software/gridware/">SGE</ulink>,
    <ulink url="http://www.platform.com/">LSF</ulink> or
    <ulink url="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/">Condor</ulink>, and each one is
    used for different underlying computer architectures and execution profiles.
    In any case their  benefits in cost minimization and performance
    maximization are mainly due to greater utilization of underlying resources.
    </para>

    <para>
    <emphasis>Even though DRM systems share many capabilities, mainly batch
    queuing, job scheduling and resource management; they do not provide a
    common interface and security framework, and so their integration is not
    possible.</emphasis> Such lack of interoperability involves the existence
    within an organization of independent computational platforms
    <emphasis>(vertical silos)</emphasis> responsible for distinct functions
    that require specialized administration skills and generates
    over-provisioning and global load unbalance. Moreover, such technologies
    are also unsuitable to build computational infrastructures where resources
    are scattered across several administrative domains, each with its own
    security policy and DRM system. A grid infrastructure offers a common layer
    to integrate these non-interoperable computational platforms by defining a
    consistent set of abstraction and interfaces for access to, and management
    of, shared resources
    (<ulink url="http://www.ggf.org/documents/Diff_Faces_foster.pdf">Ian Foster
    and Steven Tuecke's article from the Enterprise Distributed Computing
    issue of ACM Queue, Vol. 3, No. 6 - July/August 2005</ulink>).

  <title>What is Globus?</title>

    <para>
    <emphasis>The <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/">Globus Toolkit</ulink>, a
    de facto standard in grid computing, is open source software that implements
    a collection of high level services at the grid infrastructure layer.
    </emphasis> These services include, among others, resource monitoring and
    discovery services (MDS), resource allocation and management (GRAM), a
    security infrastructure (GSI), and file transfer services (RFT). These
    services and libraries allow secure and transparent access to computing and
    data resources across multiple administrative domains. The Globus Toolkit
    meets most of the abstract requirements set forth in Open Grid Services
    Architecture
    (<ulink url="http://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsa-wg/">OGSA</ulink>).
    OGSA, under development by the Global Grid Forum
    (<ulink url="http://www.gridforum.org/">GGF</ulink>), aims to define a
    common, standard, and open architecture for the grid. The Web Services
    Resource Framework (<ulink url="http://www.globus.org/wsrf/">WSRF</ulink>),
    developed by <ulink url="http://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</ulink>, defines
    a family of specifications based on standard Web Services to access the
    stateful resources that OGSA needs. In fact, the Globus Toolkit is
    implemented on top of the WSRF standard. Several
    <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/grid_software/computation/">open-source
    software components</ulink> are available to deploy Globus-based grid
    solutions that address the requirements of the new grid projects.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
  <title>What is GridWay?</title>

    <para>
    <emphasis>GridWay is higher-level grid middleware, which uses Globus as the
    core grid middleware. So, GridWay can be used in any grid infrastructure
    based on Globus.</emphasis> The <ulink url="http://www.gridway.org/">
    GridWay</ulink> workload manager performs job execution management and
    resource brokering on a grid consisting of distinct computing platforms
    managed by Globus services. GridWay allows unattended, reliable, and efficient
    execution of single, array, or complex jobs on heterogeneous and dynamic
    grids. GridWay performs all the job scheduling and submission steps
    transparently to the end user and adapts job execution to changing grid
    conditions by providing fault recovery mechanisms, dynamic scheduling,
    migration on-request and opportunistic migration. GridWay on Globus provides
    decoupling between applications and the underlying local management systems.

  <title>Grid Scheduling Infrastructure Taxonomy</title>

    <para>
    The following taxonomy, according to the level of cross-organizational
    distribution, is the most popular in today's Grid computing environments.
    </para>

    <para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
      <para>
      <emphasis>Departmental grids</emphasis> are similar in functionality to
      compute clusters. They are owned by one user group and managed by one of
      the DRM systems described above with the aim of greater utilization of
      underlying resources. It is clear that we do not need the Globus toolkit
      for the deployment of this kind of infrastructures.
      </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
      <para>
      <emphasis>Enterprise grids</emphasis> comprise several departmental grids.
      They are managed by the organization to enable diverse resource sharing
      and improve internal collaboration and achieve a better return from their
      information technology investment. Peak computing demand could be
      satisfied within the enterprise by integrating clusters and departmental
      grids. In this case, we may need the Globus toolkit to provide a common
      layer to integrate these non-interoperable computational platforms and
      the GridWay meta-scheduler to provide job management and resource
      brokering support.
      </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
      <para>
      <emphasis>Partner grids</emphasis> of several scales will be mainly
      deployed within the context of different research projects, whose final
      goal is to provide large-scale, secure and reliable sharing of resources
      among partner organizations and supply-chain participants. Such partner
      grids allow access to a higher computing performance to satisfy peak
      demands and also provide support to face collaborative projects. These
      infrastructures require the Globus toolkit and the GridWay meta-scheduler
      to build computational infrastructures where resources are scattered
      across several administrative domains, each with its own security policy
      and DRM system.

  <title>GridWay Architecture</title>

    <para>
    In GridWay 4.0.2, we introduced an architecture for the execution manager
    module based on a MAD (Middleware Access Driver) to interface Grid execution
    services. In this release we have taken advantage of this architecture to
    implement an information manager module with a MAD that interfaces Grid
    information services, and a transfer manager module with a MAD that
    interfaces Grid data services. Moreover, we have decoupled the scheduling
    process from the dispatch manager through the use of a external and
    selectable scheduler module.

    <sect2>
    <title>Partner Grid Infrastructures</title>

      <para>
      Partner grid infrastructures of several scales are being deployed within
      the context of different research projects, whose final goal is to provide
      large-scale, secure and reliable sharing of resources among partner
      organizations and supply-chain participants. Such partner grids allow
      access to a higher computing performance to satisfy peak demands and also
      provide support to face collaborative projects. The multiple
      administration domains existing in a partner grid infrastructure prevent
      the deployment of centralized meta-schedulers, with total control over
      client requests and resource status.
      </para>

      <sect3>
      <title>User-level Meta-scheduling Infrastructures</title>

        <para>
        Most of current meta-schedulers are user-level tools that provide
        scheduling and job management functionality. This means that there is
        one scheduling instance for each user, and all scheduling instances
        compete with each other for the available resources. In this scenario,
        GridWay is installed in single-user mode by each end-user on his client
        host.
        </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
      <title>Organization-level Meta- scheduling Infrastructures</title>

        <para>
        User-level meta-scheduling deployment may exhibit technical and
        socio-political difficulties within an organization, namely: the end
        users are responsible for the installation and administration of the
        meta-scheduler, a Globus client installation is required in each
        end-user system and firewall configuration must allow traffic between
        grid resources and end user systems. Undoubtedly, an approach that
        gives administrators full control of meta-scheduling deployment could
        help overcome these difficulties. Organization-level meta-schedulers
        provide support for multiple intra-organization users in each scheduling
        instance. This means that there is one scheduling instance for each
        organization, and all scheduling instances compete with each other for
        the available resources.
        </para>

        <para>
        In this scenario, GridWay is configured in multiple-user mode. This way
        the installation and configuration of GridWay will be performed by each
        system manager and the users could submit, control and monitor their
        jobs from a front-end or from submission hosts (that do not require
        GridWay and Globus installation).

    <title>Enterprise Grid Infrastructures</title>

      <para>
      Enterprise grids enable diverse resource sharing to improve internal
      collaboration and achieve a better return from information technology
      investment. Available resources within a company are better exploited
      and the administrative overhead is minimized by using Grid technology.
      The resources are part of the same administrative domain. Theses
      infrastructures require a centralized approach for scheduling and
      accounting. The administrator must be able to apply centralized usage
      policies and access to global reporting and accounting. Enterprise grid
      infrastructures require meta-schedulers to provide support for multiple
      users in a single scheduling instance.
      </para>

      <para>
      In this scenario, GridWay is installed in multiple-user mode. This way
      the installation and configuration of GridWay will be performed by the
      system manager and the users could submit, control and monitor their
      jobs from a front-end or from submission hosts (that do not require
      GridWay and Globus installation).

  <title>Multiple-User Mode Installation</title>

  <para>
  In this scenario, the installation of GridWay is performed by the system
  manager and the users are able to submit, control and monitor their jobs
  from a front-end (GridWay server host) or from client hosts, which may not
  require a GridWay/Globus installation.  This means that there is one GridWay
  installation for each organization that provides support for multiple
  intra-organization users.
  </para>

  <para>
  Note that GridWay daemon SHOULD NOT be run as root. Only part of the
  installation will require privileged access.
  </para>

    all of the files in the GridWay installation, all of the daemons in the
    GridWay execution and it can be used to configure GridWay once it is
    installed. Primary group of <filename>&lt;adminuser></filename>

</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
    Usually <command>sudo</command> clears all environment variables for
    security reasons. However MADs need the <command>GW_LOCATION</command>
    and <command>GLOBUS_LOCATION</command> variables to be set. To preserve
    those variables in the MAD environment, add the following line to your
    <filename>sudoers</filename> file:
    <screen>Defaults>GW_USERS env_keep="GW_LOCATION GLOBUS_LOCATION"</screen>
    </para>
    <para>
    Please refer to the <command>sudo</command> manual page for more
    information.
    </para>

    <para>
    To test the <command>sudo</command> command configuration try to execute a
    MAD as a user in the <filename>&lt;gwgroup></filename> group, for example:
    <screen>
$ sudo -u &lt;gw_user> /home/gwadmin/gw/bin/gw_em_mad_prews

    </orderedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
  Following previous steps, the end-users must login to the GridWay server host
  to be able to execute GridWay commands and use the DRMAA libraries.
  </para>

  <para>
  Additionally, client hosts, that are not required to have GridWay/Globus
  installed, could be deployed to remotely interface to the GridWay server host.
  In such a case, user accounts and home directories must be shared between
  the GridWay server and the client hosts, via for example NIS and NFS; and
  <filename>&lt;gwlocation> </filename> directory should be readable on all
  client hosts. The  <filename>&lt;gwlocation> </filename> directory may be
  available via for example NFS by exporting
  <filename>&lt;gwlocation></filename> from GridWay server,
  creating <filename>&lt;gwlocation></filename>  directory in the client
  hosts, changing its ownership to
  <filename>&lt;adminuser>:&lt;gwgroup></filename>  and mounting the
  <filename>&lt;gwlocation></filename>  directory exported by the GridWay server
  on the <filename>&lt;gwlocation></filename> of the client hosts.
  </para>

  <para>
  Following those steps, a user logged in a client hosts is able to interface
  to the GridWay daemon in the GridWay server host. However, the
  <command>grid-proxy-init</command> globus command must be executed in the
  server host in order to create a proxy by, for example, executing
  <filename>  ssh &lt;GridWay server> grid-proxy-init </filename> .

  <title>Daemon Failure Recovery</title>

  <para>
  Since GridWay 4.9, when you start the daemon, <command>gwd</command> tries
  to recover its previous state. This is, any submitted job is stored in a
  presistent pool, and in case of a gwd (or client machine) crash these jobs are
  recovered. This includes, for jobs in wrapper state, contacting with the
  remote jobmanager.
  </para>

  <para>
  Recovery actions are performed by default, if you do not want to
  recover the previous submitted jobs use the <command> -c</command> option.
  </para>

  <para>
  For example, to start gwd in multi-user mode and clear its previous state,
  use:
  </para>

  <screen>$ gwd -c -m</screen>

  GridWay uses several Middleware Access Drivers (MAD) to interface different
  Grid services. The following MADs are part of the GridWay distribution:
  </para>

  <para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
    <para>
    Execution Managers to interface pre-WS GRAM and WS GRAM services.

    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
  These drivers are configured and selected via the GWD configuration interface
  described in <xref linkend='GWDconf'>. Additionally you may need to configure
  your environment (see <xref linkend="VerifGWInst">) in order to successfully
  load the MADs into the GWD core.

  <emphasis>prews</emphasis>:
  <screen>EM_MAD = prews:gw_em_mad_prews:rsl</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
  To use WS-GRAM services you can include the following line in your
  <filename>$GW_LOCATION/etc/gwd.conf</filename> file:
  <screen>EM_MAD = ws:gw_em_mad_ws:rsl2</screen>
  </para>

  <note>
  <para>You can simultaneously use as many Execution Drivers as you need

  <sect2>
  <title>Static Discovery and Monitoring (SS mode)</title>
    <para>
    In this mode, hosts are statically discovered by reading a host list file
    (note: each time it is read). Also the attributes of each host are read
    from files. Hint: Use this mode for testing purposes and not in a production
    environment. To configure a Information Driver in SS mode use the host
    list option, for example:
    <screen>IM_MAD = static:gw_im_mad_static:-l examples/im/host.static::gridftp:ws</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
    The host list file contains one host per line, with format:

      <listitem>
      <para>
      <command>attribute_file</command>: is the name of the file with the static

  <title>Static Discovery and Dynamic Monitoring (SD mode)</title>

    <para>
    Hosts are discovered by reading a host list file. However, the information
    of each host is gathered by querying its information service (GRIS in MDS2
    or the DefaultIndexService in MDS4). Hint: Use this mode if the resources in
    your Grid does not vary too much, i.e. resource are not added or removed
    very often. To configure a Information Driver in SD mode use the host
    list option, for example:
    <screen>IM_MAD = glue:gw_im_mad_mds2_glue:-l examples/im/host.list::gridftp:prews</screen>
    </para>
    <para>
    In this case the host list file contains one host per line, with format:
    <screen>
FQDN
...
FQDN</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
    where:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
      <para>
      <command>FQDN</command>: is the Full Qualified Domain Name of the host.
      </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    For example (you can find this file in
    <filename>$GW_LOCATION/examples/im/</filename>)
    <screen>
hydrus.dacya.ucm.es
ursa.dacya.ucm.es
draco.dacya.ucm.es</screen>

    <note>
    <para>
    The information services of each host (GRIS or/and DefaultIndexServices)
    must be properly configured to use this mode.

  <title>Dynamic Discovery and Monitoring (DD mode)</title>

    <para>
    In this mode, hosts are discovered and monitored by directly accessing the
    Grid Information Service. Hint: Use this mode if the resources in your Grid
    does vary too much, i.e. resource are added or removed very often. To
    configure a Information Driver in SD mode use the server option,
    for example:
    <screen>IM_MAD = mds4:gw_im_mad_mds4:-s hydrus.dacya.ucm.es::gridftp:ws</screen>
    </para>

    <note>
    <para>
    A hierarchical information service (GIIS or/and DefaultIndexService)
    must be properly configured to use this mode.
    </para>
    </note>

    <para>
    If you are using a MDS2 information service you may need to specify the
    Virtual Organization name in the DN of the LDIF entries
    (<emphasis>Mds-vo-name</emphasis>) with the base option described above.
    </para>

    <note>
    <para>
    You can simultaneously use as many Information Drivers as you need
    (up to 10). So, GridWay allows you to simultaneously use MDS2 and MDS4
    Services. You can also use resources from different Grids at the same time.
    </para>
    </note>

    <note>
    <para>
    You can mix SS, SD and DD modes in the same Information Driver.

  <title>Scheduling Driver Configuration</title>

    <para>
    The Scheduler Driver is used to schedule jobs on the available Grid
    resources. The following schedulers are included in GridWay:
    </para>

    <para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
      <para>
      Round-Robin/Flooding: This is a simple scheduling algorithm. It maximizes
      the number of jobs submitted to the Grid. Available resources, ordered by
      rank, are flooded with user jobs in a round-robin fashion.
      (the <emphasis>User Guide</emphasis> explains how to define the rank for
      each job). The new version of this scheduler (from GridWay 5.1) also
      considers past history of Grid resources: failed executions
      are now considered when scheduling the jobs of each user.

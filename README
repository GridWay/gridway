===== WELCOME =====

The GridWay Metascheduler enables large-scale, reliable and efficient sharing 
of computing resources: clusters, supercomputers, stand-alone servers... 
It supports different LRM systems (PBS, SGE, LSF, Condor, etc.) within a 
single organization or scattered across several administrative domains. 
GridWay provides a single point of access to all resources in your 
organization, from in-house systems to Grid infrastructures and Cloud providers.

GridWay supports most of existing Grid middlewares (Globus WS and pre-WS, LCG, 
CREAM, ARC), is being used on main production Grid infrastructures (EGEE, OSG, 
TeraGrid, ...) and can dynamically access to Cloud resources (Amazon EC2, ...).


===== DOCUMENTATION =====

Since version 5.5, the documentation is completely online at
http://gridway.org/doku.php?id=documentation .


===== INSTALL =====

Check the Installation Guide and/or the Quick Installation guide for more details 
http://gridway.org/doku.php?id=documentation:release_5.5:ig .
Depending on whether you need a single-user or multi-user, it gets slightly more 
complex due to the role of gridway administrator.
In any case, it summarizes to ten steps:

0) Make sure you have installed and running a working Globus Toolkit (recommended 
the latest 4.2).
1) Pre-install a set of packages (make, gcc, java, libssl-dev [openssl-devel], 
perl, libnet-ldap-perl [perl-LDAP], ruby, ruby-dev [ruby-devel]).
2) Set up the gwuser (also the gwadmin for administratio of multi-user) and the env
variables $GW_LOCATION, $GLOBUS_LOCATION, $JAVA_HOME, $PATH, $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
3) Enter the downloaded directory, either after uncompression or svn check out.
4) ./configure
5) make
6) make install
7) Configure GridWay (http://gridway.org/doku.php?id=documentation:release_5.5:cg)
through the files $GW_LOCATION/etc/gwd.conf y $GW_LOCATION/etc/sched.conf.
8) Launch the gridway daemon from $GW_LOCATION/bin/gwd.
9) Test it and enjoy!

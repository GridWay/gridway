===== WELCOME =====

The GridWay Metascheduler enables large-scale, reliable and efficient sharing 
of computing resources: clusters, supercomputers, stand-alone servers... 
It supports different LRM systems (PBS, SGE, LSF, Condor, etc.) within a 
single organization or scattered across several administrative domains. 
GridWay provides a single point of access to all resources in your 
organization, from in-house systems to Grid infrastructures and Cloud providers.

GridWay supports most of existing Grid middlewares (Globus WS and pre-WS, LCG, 
CREAM, ARC), is being used on main production Grid infrastructures (EGEE, OSG, 
TeraGrid...) and can dynamically access to Cloud resources (Amazon EC2).


===== DOCUMENTATION =====

===== INSTALL =====

Check the Installation Guide and/or the Quick Installation guide for more details 
http://gridway.org/doku.php?id=documentation:release_5.7:ig .
Depending on whether you need a single-user or multi-user configuration, it gets
slightly more complex due to the role of gridway administrator.
In any case, it summarizes to these steps:

0) Make sure you have installed and running a working Globus Toolkit (recommended 
the latest 5.0.3).
1) Install the required packages (make, gcc, java, libssl-dev [openssl-devel], perl,
libnet-ldap-perl [perl-LDAP], ruby, ruby-dev [ruby-devel]).
2) In a multi-user configuration, create the gwusers group and the gwadmin user.
3) Set the envinronment ($GW_LOCATION, $GLOBUS_LOCATION, $JAVA_HOME, $PATH,
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH...)
4) Enter the downloaded directory, either after uncompression or svn check out.
5) ./configure
6) make
7) make install
8) Build and install the needed drivers executing make and make install, in
$GW_LOCATION/src/{im_mad,em_mad,tm_mad}.
9) Configure GridWay (http://gridway.org/doku.php?id=documentation:release_5.7:cg)
through the files $GW_LOCATION/etc/gwd.conf and $GW_LOCATION/etc/sched.conf.
10) Launch the gridway daemon from $GW_LOCATION/bin/gwd.
11) Test it and enjoy!

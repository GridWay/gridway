====== Release Notes 5.14 ======

GridWay 5.14 is a new stable version of the fifth series of the metascheduler.

Release date: April 1st, 2013

===== New EMI-ES driver (Tech Preview) =====

A technology preview of a EMI-ES driver based on an ARC Client plug-in is now
available for testing.

===== Send usage statistics to (E)GSC =====

GridWay now can send usage statistics to a Globus Statistics Collector.

===== Other features =====

Now the target implementation for BES driver is provided in the host contact,
instead of using the -t option of the driver. Therefore, LRMS_NAME should be
"bes-<target>-<lrms>", with target being "gridsam" or "unicore".

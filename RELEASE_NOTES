====== Release Notes 5.8 RC1 ======

GridWay 5.8 RC1 is the new development version of the fifth series of the metascheduler.

Release date: August 18th, 2011.

===== Modified Installation Procedure =====

GridWay core and commands are now configured, built and installed separately from the MADs, which have their own Makefile.

This way, GridWay installation does not depend on the installation of a given middleware.

===== Randomized Job State Polling =====

Job state is polled at randomized intervals, to avoid saturation due to multiple simultaneous requests. Moreover, the interval is duplicated when a failure occurs.

===== CREAM Middleware Access Driver (MAD) =====

An execution driver for CREAM (http://grid.pd.infn.it/cream), the job submission and management interface of gLite, is included in this release.

===== OGSA-BES Middleware Access Driver (MAD) =====

A technology preview of an execution driver for OGSA-BES (www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.108.pdf), the OGF specification for job submission and management, is included in this release.

===== Syslog Compliant Logs =====

GridWay offers the opportunity to write logs in the Syslog format. You can configure GridWay using --with-syslog option. Optionally, you can use a particular facility (LOG_DAEMON, LOG_USER, or LOG_LOCAL[0-7]).

===== Translation of Resource Requirements in Job Template =====

A translation mechanism of resource requirements in job templates to RSL, JDL and JSDL is available. You can explicitly set the maximum cputime, walltime, and/or maximum and minimum amount of memory for a single execution of the executable, by means of the ENVIRONMENT variables MAXCPUTIME, MAXTIME, MAXWALLTIME, MAXMEMORY and MINMEMORY in job templates.

===== Disposing Jobs when DONE =====

A new option to gwd (-d) is added to dispose jobs when they are done.

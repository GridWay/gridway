====== Release Notes 5.12 ======

GridWay 5.12 is a new stable version of the fifth series of the metascheduler.

Release date: September 30th, 2012

===== Improved BES driver =====

The BES driver now includes Transport-level security, instead of Message-level
security. Also, transfers are specified in JSDL, so they do not depend on globus-url-copy.

===== Improved CREAM driver =====

Multithreading has been improved. Also, it now takes advantage of the new QueryEvent operation
in CREAM to improve job monitoring.

  * Bug #126 (http://dev.gridway.org/issues/126): Type and count not specified in RSL2 for wrapper-based submission
  * Bug #127 (http://dev.gridway.org/issues/127): Missing special wrapper for SSH drivers
  * Bug #131 (http://dev.gridway.org/issues/131): EM driver reload leaves jobs in WRAP state forever

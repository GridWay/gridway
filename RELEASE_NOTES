====== Release Notes 5.7 ======

GridWay 5.7 is the new development version of the fifth series of the metascheduler.

Release date: March 31st, 2011.

===== Modified installation procedure =====

GridWay core and commands are now configured, built and installed separately from the MADs, which have their own Makefile.

This way, GridWay installation does not depend on the installation of a given middleware.

===== Randomized Job State Polling =====

Job state is polled at randomized intervals, to avoid saturation due to multiple simultaneous requests. Moreover, the interval is duplicated when a failure occur.

===== CREAM Middleware Access Driver (MAD) =====

A technology preview of an execution driver for CREAM (http://grid.pd.infn.it/cream), the job submission and management interface of gLite, is included in this release.

===== OGSA-BES Middleware Access Driver (MAD) =====

A technology preview of an execution driver for OGSA-BES (www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.108.pdf), the OGF specification for job submission and management, is included in this release.
